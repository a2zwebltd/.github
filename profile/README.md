# A2Z WEB

Fractional CTO leadership, hands-on delivery, and AI automation for companies that need systems that ship, scale, and stay auditable.

## What we do

* AI automation
  Design and implementation of AI-powered workflows connected to real systems. Emphasis on control, auditability, failure handling, and human-in-the-loop execution.

* CTO as a Service
  Fractional or interim CTO work covering strategy, architecture, delivery oversight, and investor-facing communication. Built by operators, not advisors.

* Custom software development
  Products, platforms, and APIs. Greenfield builds, legacy modernisation, and long-term ownership.

* Technology audits and strategy
  Independent technical audits of startups and scaleups. Architecture, code quality, delivery risk, and concrete remediation plans.

* Investor-grade execution audits
  Pre-investment and post-investment audits focused on execution risk, scalability, and technical defensibility.

* Tech hiring support
  Role definition, interview process design, technical screening, and senior engineer assessment.
